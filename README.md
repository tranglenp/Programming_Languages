# My Knowledges after learing OSSU courses: Programming Languages!
The course Programming Languages (Part A, B, C: https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) introduces to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.
My review about this course: It is a wonderful course with a wide range of topics in programming languages taught by Mr. Dan Grossman, who is such a high motivating teacher!
